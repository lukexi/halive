TODO:

[ ] Figure out how to make Halive work on windows

[ ] Flag handling update: 
    The three below would be subsumed by just using the parseStaticFlags/parseDynamicFlags
    functions to set up DynFlags, and then parsing out the included paths from there. That way we
    act nearly identically to 'ghc'/'ghci'/'runhaskell'.

        [ ] Add -Wall support
            https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/ghc/DynFlags.html#t:Settings

        [ ] Add general GHC flag support, which should be easy enough

        [ ] Watch all included path trees rather than the current directory.

[ ] Configurable watched filetypes, either with a dotfile or flags

[ ] Bug: halive crashes if multiple files are saved/added at once

[ ] Sort-of-bug: some editors do a delete/replace instead of a modify on files, so we don't see the change. Only watching for modify makes sense since creations and deletions can't affect running code until something is modified, and watching for them might unnecessarily halt your program while you're working on creating a file. So possibly make this optional.

[ ] Add helpers for restarting user threads

[ ] Improve Control-C handling

[ ] Try integrating different debugging workflows.
    putStrLn/trace debugging is already a lot nicer with Halive since you can
    toggle them on and off while the program is running. Expand on this
    to begin subsuming some of the functionality of a typical debugger,
    except with just plain old code. 
    E.g., a breakpoint can just be an STM transaction that 'retry's 
    on a global boolean TVar when it's false
    Re-add a REPL that can be used to query program information.
    Add tools to place and record state history into global variables that can be
    queried by the REPL.
    Be sure to compare these with ekg, GHC's eventlog.
    
[ ] Check if we need foreign-store at all; it seems like global MVars would do the trick just as well.

[ ] Can fix Halive breaking with .o files present
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12790341/haskell-ghc-dynamic-compliation-only-works-on-first-compile
    target <- guessTarget "*Test.hs" Nothing
    addTarget target

DONE
[x] Add program command line argument support.
    I'm guessing that programs run under Halive will currently get Halive's own command line args.
    We could use the -- convention to separate halive arguments from program arguments,
    and call withArgs before running the program's "main".
    
    Once we've got this, we should be able to live edit Halive's source with Halive which should
    be a fun demo.
    (done thanks to Jonathan Geddes @jargv !)

NOTES:

Main source lives in exec/Halive.hs

I couldn't make halive as a library due to an oddity with
ghc @rpaths suddently not resolving. 

Should you base things off the code, be aware that executables
must be built with the -dynamic flag for ghc or else strange errors 
may occur when interfacing with external libraries like CoreFoundation
(GHCi uses this flag for its executable as well).
